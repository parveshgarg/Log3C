This is the fork of logpai/Log3C. Here, I'm trying to

* restructure code as I understand it better
  * variable names, file names, function names
  * indentation
  * removing timing code to using decorator
  * use argparse
  * etc

* dockerize the project

* reverse engineer to create examples

* and may be add unit tests

* last but not the least, not claim this project to be mine :)
